"""
Hierarchical Forecast Reconciliation.

Ensures forecasts are coherent across the M5 hierarchy:
- Bottom-up: item-store → department → category → store → state → total
- Forecasts at aggregated levels should equal the sum of children

Uses a differentiable reconciliation layer inspired by MinT
(Minimum Trace optimal reconciliation, Wickramasuriya et al. 2019).
